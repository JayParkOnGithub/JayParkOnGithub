Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jay and I'm currently a full stack developer at LND. With a passion for creating dynamic and responsive web applications, my tech stack includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and more. I also have experience with both NoSQL and SQL databases and implementation of effective testing.

I'm committed to staying up to date with the latest technologies and methodologies to ensure that I'm bringing my A game to any project that I work on. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym, playing Overwatch (poorly), or trying out the newest burger place.

Feel free to contact me!
